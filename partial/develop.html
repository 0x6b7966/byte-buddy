    <h2>Getting started</h2>

    <p>
        First, you need to create a copy of Byte Buddy on your local machine. Simply clone Byte Buddy's repository
        by using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> or by cloning it directly on
        <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a>. Once the repository was cloned, you can build the project using
        the <a href="http://www.gradle.org/">Gradle</a> wrapper that ships with it. From your shell, this might look
        something like this: <pre>git clone https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy.git
cd byte-buddy
gradlew build</pre>
    Before you start to code, make sure that all test cases run successful. This should be the case at all times for
    the <a href="https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy/tree/master"><code>master</code></a> branch of Byte Buddy. This
    is hopefully confirmed by our current <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a> build which currently is
    <a href="https://travis-ci.org/raphw/byte-buddy">
        <img style="max-width:100%;"

             alt="Byte Buddy build status"
             src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ad380eebb5950663e31d1b61741b39e6b5f0cbc7/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f72617068772f627974652d62756464792e706e67">
    </a>
    and which is constantly monitoring Byte Buddy's latest state. Travis is configured to compile and test the project
    for the <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">Open JDK</a> versions 6 and 7 and the
    <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html">Oracle JDK</a> versions
    7 and 8. Since some of our tests are creating and loading Java classes, we make sure that the generated classes
    do not use a format that cannot be understood by a specific Java version. If you are making changes to Byte Buddy
    that directly affect the generated byte code, please make sure to sufficiently test your build using different Java
    versions before committing your changes. All this implies that you need to write Java code that is compatible to a
    Java 6 compiler.

    <h2>Contribute</h2>

    <p>
        When you have fixed a bug, simply create a <a href="https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy/pulls">pull request</a>
        on GitHub. We will look into the matter as quickly as possible, once we receive the notification. Make however
        sure that you have accurately described your changes and the fixed issue and please provide a test case that
        reproduces the problem and proves that your fix is working. This makes our work much easier and we will be able
        to apply your patch much quicker. If you add new non-private methods, fields or types, make sure to write some
        in-code documentation that describes their purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are contributing a feature, please get in touch before spending a lot of time with it such that we can
        discuss how your changes are meaningful at Byte Buddy's current development state. Byte Buddy is meant to
        steadily provide more functionality but we do not grow its feature set on the expense of its stability and
        code consistency. However, do not be discouraged by this announcement. If you got deep enough into Byte
        Buddy's source to being able to implement a new awesome feature that you want to share, you did for sure give
        it some thought and we will do our best to merge it into our build! Simply come talk to us and we are more
        than happy to welcome you on board.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you feel like contributing to Byte Buddy's documentation, to its description on this web page or even to the
        structure and design of this web page, you are absolutely welcome to do so! We deeply believe that a thorough
        and up-to-date documentation is the key to a successful project and we will do our best to live up to this
        conviction. Even minor changes are welcome as long as they improve Byte Buddy's accessibility or appearance,
        because in the end, this project was made for its users. Simply clone this web page which is hosted on GitHub
        in the project's <a href="https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy/tree/gh-pages"><code>gh-pages</code></a> branch.
        The web page was created using <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular JS</a> and
